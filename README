Welcome to Bob.

Bob is an abstraction of general document definition and display markup whereby
simple patterns of structured content can be created, mixed and reused.

Project Goals:
  1. Content-orientation: we should be describing content, not the structure
     used to display it
  2. Human-readability: it should be easy for a human to write documents, and
     hence easy to maintain them
  3. Implementation independence: since we're content-oriented, it should be
     possible to output HAML, or XML, or plain-text instead of hardwired XHTML
  4. Extensibility: it should be possible to easily extend the solution to
     handle new behaviour, as it is required

For Users:
  Bob works by interpreting document definitions in YAML, for example:

    Form:
        - Control:
            name: name
        - Control:
            name: age
        - Control:
            name: gender
            type: select
            options:
              - male
              - female

Each camelcase node indicates a "component" - an abstract part of the document,
usually with a specific purpose, and which displays in a unique way. In the
above example, the "Form" and "Control" nodes indicate components, the rest of
the information describes those components.
