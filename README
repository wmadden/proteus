Welcome to Proteus.

Proteus is an abstraction of general document definition and display markup that
allows you to create and reuse complex patterns of structured content.

The purpose of Proteus is to allow you to describe documents in terms of their
content, abstracting away from the often cumbersome markup or syntax of its
native form (for example in HTML).

Project Goals:
  1. Content-orientation: we should be describing content, not the structure
     used to display it.
  2. Human-readability: it should be easy for a human to write and maintain
     documents.
  3. Flexibility: it should be easy to adapt the solution to solve a wide
     variety of problems.
  4. Extensibility: it should be easy to change the behaviour of the system as
     it is required.

For Users:
  Proteus works by interpreting document definitions in YAML, for example:
  
    Form:
        - Control:
            name: name
        - Control:
            name: age
        - Control:
            name: gender
            type: select
            options:
              - male
              - female

Each camelcase node indicates a "component" - a piece of content which displays
in a unique way. In the above example, the "Form" and "Control" nodes are
components and the rest of the information describes those components.

For Developers:
  Proteus provides a simple system for describing new component types that
permits inheritance and composition of existing types, again in human readable
syntax. This allows users to create custom languages from existing components
quickly and easily.

The Name:
  In Greek mythology, Proteus is an early sea-god who can foretell the future,
and will change his shape to avoid having to. From this feature of Proteus comes
the adjective protean, with the general meaning of "versatile", "mutable",
"capable of assuming many forms". -- Wikipedia
